# Spearman's Test
To run the test, pass two parameters to the script as below:
```
python spearmanr.py <word_representations> <test_data>
```

# Word Analogy
For this test, you must pass a .bin model (such as a fastText model) and a test file to the script:
```
python word_analogy.py <word_representation_model> <test_data>
```

# Test Data
For both tests, we have provided test data:
* `fa-ws353` for Spearman's test
* `word-analogy` for the word analogy test
